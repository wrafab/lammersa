<H3> Rotation 3 | Design/Garment and Sublimation Printing</h3>
<p> 
The assignment for this rotation was to use Adobe Photoshop and CorelDraw to make unique images and designs to put on different objects.
  The first was a T-shirt, where I put a picture of Lebron James dunking. I first cut him out of a picture I found online. Then, I tried to create a dispersion/splatter effect using different brushes
  and layers. I also put the Cavs logo above him.

  <img src="Lebron.jpg" class="centerImage" style="width:500px;height:500px;">
  <br>
  
  Printing was very easy. I first pressed my t-shirt in order to get the wrinkles out. Then, I aligned the t-shirt in the printer and simply 
  plugged in the USB with my edited image into the printer and hit print. Finally, I pressed it once again and my t-shirt was finished.

 The second tool we got to use was sublimation printing. I chose to do a phone case for my project. I used the iPhone 7 phonecase template on 
  CorelDraw and put an image of a waterfall from Yosemite National Park from my summer trip. I then put my name on the bottom of the image
