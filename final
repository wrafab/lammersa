For my final project, I chose to make a smartphone projector. Our assignment was to use atleast four processes in the making of our final
project. 
For the projector, I designed a box to encase the projector using CorelDraw and lasercutting. I then glued the box together, and inserted a magnifying glass
so that the light from the phone screen would be projected through the lense and made larger. I then spray painted the box black, and designed
a couple stickers using Corel. One was of the Cavs logo, the other was a cool edit of Lebron James. I also designed a phonestand in Fusion 360
and 3D Printed it. This would ensure that my phone wouldn't slide or fall, and keep the image/video being projected as still as possible.

Processes:
 - CAD (Computer Aided Design)
 - Laser Cutting (Subtractive Manufacturing)
 - 3D Printing (Sddative Manufacturing)
 - Sticker Printing
 
 Final Product!
