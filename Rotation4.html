<H3> Rotation 4 | Laser Cutting, Engraving and Vinyl Cutting Assignment </h3>
<p> 
The assignment for this rotation was to utilize the laser cutter to make four different things:
  <br>
  The first thing I did was make a cardboard box. The box was engraved with images of famous buildings on five faces, and my initials on one face.
  I simply imported the images to Corel Draw, went to "Trace Bitmap", and then I selected "detailed logo" from the menu. I then copied those onto
  a box designed on makercase.
  <br>
  <img src="CardboardBox.jpg" class="centerImage" style="width:500px;height:500px;">

  <br>
  Next, I used the same technique on Corel Draw to get a detailed logo of the Cleveland Indian's logo. I then laser engraved
  That design on a cork coaster.

  <br>
  Then, I designed a press fit kit with square, triangular, and rectangular pieces using Corel Draw. I had to make sure that the slits
  in the cardboard were 1/8 an inch to match the thickness of the cardboard. I also had to be sure to select "Hairline" in Corel Draw so that 
  the pieces would cut all the way out rather than just engraving.
  <br>

  <hr style="width:50%">

  <br> 
  Finally, I engraved a glass using the laser machine. This time, I chose the Cavs logo to engrave. I had to  put in a special insert in the laser engraver
  So that the glass would spin while it was engraving.
