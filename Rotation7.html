<H3> Rotation 7 | Lamination and Vacuum Forming Assignment</h3>
<p> 
The assignment for this rotation was to create a skateboard. The skateboard was originally composed of seven pieces of wood with different
  directions of grooves for strength. I took one of the pieces and laser engraved the Cleveland skyline into it. I then laminated the board
  with Titebond III glue. Then, I vaccuum sealed it around a styrafoam mold so that it would take the shape of a skateboard. Finally, after
  after a day of vaccuum sealing, I sanded the edges and coated it with SPAR Urethane.
